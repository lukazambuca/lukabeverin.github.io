***Estimating the Tail Index of a Truncated Extened Pareto Model

We proposed a truncated Extended Pareto Distribution estimator of the tail index through an exhaus-
tive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Our proposed estimator outperformed other estimation
methods at different levels of truncation. This research report was completed with distinction during
my Honours year at the University of Pretoria.

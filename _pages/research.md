#### Estimating the Tail Index of a Truncated Extened Pareto Model (2019)

##### Abstract:

<sub><sup>In extreme value statistics, the Pareto distribution (PD) is a good fit to relative exceedances
above a predetermined threshold. However, the PD typically requires a high threshold, leaving an
insufficient amount of data to be modelled. For this reason, Beirlant et al. (2009) introduced an
extension of the PD for heavy-tailed distributions, which has been shown to reduce the bias of the
extreme value index (EVI) estimates. In practice, data may be truncated due to some study design
or natural cause. We therefore purpose a truncated Bayesian estimator of the EVI for the extended
Pareto distribution (EPD). We investigate the performance of our estimator in comparison to other
estimators through a simulation study. The novelty of this research report is that the fitting of a
truncated EPD on truncated extremes has not been considered in literature.
